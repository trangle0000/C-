# Final Homework 4 – Labour Market Dynamics (C++ & Python Project)
## Project Description
This project analyzes unemployment data over 12 months and visualizes trends using both **C++ (Matplot++)** and **Python (matplotlib)**.
The goal is to fulfill the requirements for Topic 3: **Labour Market Dynamics**, including:
- Input and analysis of monthly unemployment rates
- Identification of causes and suggested solutions
- Visualization of unemployment trends
- Usage of Lecture 12 libraries: Matplot++, Plotutils or matplotlib
## Project Structure
Final Homework 4
├── labour_forecast.cpp            # C++ program: input + Matplot++ visualization + export CSV
├── Labour Market Dynamics.py      # Python script: read CSV + matplotlib chart
├── unemployment.csv               # Output CSV file generated by C++
└── unemployment_python_chart.png  # Output chart image from Python
```
### How to Run
### Step 1: Run C++ Program

Make sure Matplot++ is installed and linked correctly.
```bash
g++ labour_forecast.cpp -std=c++17 -I[matplot_include_path] -L[matplot_lib_path] -lmatplot -o forecast
./forecast
```

This will:
- Ask for 12 monthly unemployment rates
- Plot the chart in C++ using Matplot++
- Export data to `unemployment.csv`

### Step 2: Run Python Visualization

Install required packages if not already:
```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas
```

Then run:
```bash
python "Labour Market Dynamics.py"
```

This will:
- Read `unemployment.csv`
- Plot and save `unemployment_python_chart.png`

## Learning Objectives

- Understand unemployment patterns and causes
- Combine C++ analytical logic with Python plotting
- Use Matplot++ and matplotlib (or Plotutils) for visualization
- Practice file I/O between C++ and Python
